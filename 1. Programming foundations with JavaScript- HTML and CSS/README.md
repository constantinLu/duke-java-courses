# Programming foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS

### About the Course

Learn foundational programming concepts (e.g., functions, for loops, conditional statements) and how to solve problems like a programmer. In addition, learn basic web development as you build web pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. By the end of the course, will create a web page where others can upload their images and apply image filters that you create.

2. Write JavaScript programs using functions, for loops, and conditional statements;
3. Use HTML to construct a web page with paragraphs, divs, images, links, and lists;
4. Add styles to a web page with CSS IDs and classes; and
