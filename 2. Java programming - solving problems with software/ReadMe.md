# Duke-Java-Programming-Solving-Problems-with-Software

## About this Course:
  Learn to code in Java and improve your programming and problem-solving skills. You will learn to design algorithms as well as develop and debug programs. Using custom open-source classes, you will write programs that access and transform images, websites, and other types of data. At the end of the course you will build a program that determines the popularity of different baby names in the US over time by analyzing comma separated value (CSV) files. 

  After completing this course you will be able to:
 1. Edit, compile, and run a Java program;
 2. Use conditionals and loops in a Java program;
 3. Use Java API documentation in writing programs. 
 4. Debug a Java program using the scientific method;
 5. Write a Java method to solve a specific problem;
 6. Develop a set of test cases as part of developing a program;
 7. Create a class with multiple methods that work together to solve a problem; and
 8. Use divide-and-conquer design techniques for a program that uses multiple methods.
